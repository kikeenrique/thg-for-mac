# TortoiseHG Mac OS

This repository contains a set of scripts to build a dmg file ready to install TortoiseHG.
Also, you can find a dmg file for each tagged release.

## Releases

Go to <https://github.com/kikeenrique/thg-for-mac/releases>

## Build from source

Download the code and execute the build.sh script (is expected to be run from the root directory of the project)

It will download the required dependencies and build a dmg file from the versions currently set on scripts.
